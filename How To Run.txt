Controlfx:

3. You just downloaded a jar file, move that jar file to your javafx folder's lib folder.

7. Click apply/ok then close project structure.

8. Done.

Edit Configurations:

For the files you want to run (In our case the GameStart, but you may have Test UI files you want to run) go to Run > Edit Configurations
and select your main class. For its VM Options, copy paste this in there (except change the part I marked below):
--module-path **PATH TO YOUR JAVAFX FOLDER**\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media
and click Apply then OK. You are done with JavaFx

Copy and paste this to the text box:

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.typhon0</groupId>
  <artifactId>AnimateFX</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.1</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>

then click OK, it will download it for you.

You are done with installing AnimateFX.

How to add javafx.media:

Open edit configuration of GameApplication.
At VM options, add javafx.media to the end of the line.
Click OK. It is done!

AFTER YOU HAVE DONE BOTH, YOU CAN RUN THE MAIN UI CLASSES OF THE PROJECT!
